DESCRIPTION

A home brewed url shortener with a couple of extra features, like:
- limit access to the 'masked' url to a certain number of hits
- have the ability to notify (using several channels, in the future like mail, twitter or smoke signs) when any url is accessed (or tried to)
- add notes to each instance

The two main concepts are: url and instance, additionally there are log entries.

Each url is stored uniquely in the database, if two different users want to add the same url, the url stays the same in a single database row, but a new 'instance' is created. Actually there is exactly one instance for each user/url pair.

URL A -+- INSTANCE 1 +
       |             · -  USER 1
       +- INSTANCE 2 +
       |             
       +- INSTANCE 3 + 
                     · -  USER 2
URL B -+- INSTANCE 4 +
